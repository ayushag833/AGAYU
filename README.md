### AGAYU: An EdTech Platform

AGAYU is an edtech platform designed to make quality education accessible to everyone. Built using the MERN stack, this large-scale project has been a significant learning experience for me, as I developed it entirely on my own.

Working on AGAYU has boosted my confidence in full-stack web development. The MSP of this platform is the distinct role-based user experience, offering three different dashboards tailored for each user type.

The name "AGAYU" is a personal touch, derived from my name --> '*AG*'garwal, and '*AYU*'sh. This project has not only enhanced my technical skills but also humbled me ðŸ˜Œ.
